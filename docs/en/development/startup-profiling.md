# Startup profiling baseline

This document records the pre-optimization startup baseline at commit
`d8088ca9` and describes the opt-in trace used to compare later changes.

## Enable the trace

Set `KT_STARTUP_TRACE` to a JSONL base path before launching a surface. For
process-launch measurements, also set the wall-clock origin immediately before
starting the process:

```powershell
$env:KT_STARTUP_TRACE = "$PWD\startup.jsonl"
$env:KT_STARTUP_ORIGIN_NS = python -c "import time; print(time.time_ns())"
python -m kohakuterrarium web --dev
```

The tracer writes one process shard per PID, for example
`startup.1234.jsonl`, preventing desktop parent and child writes from corrupting
each other. Each line contains the event name, process ID, parent process ID,
run ID, process-local elapsed time, wall-clock time, and `startup_ms`. The latter
uses a shared `KT_STARTUP_ORIGIN_NS` propagated to child processes, so desktop
parent and child events are comparable. If callers do not supply a run ID or
origin, the first instrumented process creates and exports them, but that
automatic origin starts at trace-module import rather than OS process launch.

Tracing is disabled by default. File and serialization errors are ignored so
profiling cannot prevent startup.

## Baseline environment

- Windows
- Python 3.14.2
- Source checkout at `d8088ca9`
- Shared virtual environment, with `PYTHONPATH` forced to this worktree's `src`
- Warm operating-system file cache
- Five fresh process runs per reported median
- Minimal terminal fixture with `input: none`, `output: none`, no session
- `kt web --dev` used because `web_dist` is an untracked build artifact

These numbers are for comparison on this machine, not cross-machine budgets.

## Uninstrumented baseline

| Measurement | p50 |
| --- | ---: |
| Python empty process | 44.9 ms |
| `import kohakuterrarium` | 4953.3 ms |
| `import kohakuterrarium.__main__` | 4928.2 ms |
| `import kohakuterrarium.cli` | 5780.5 ms |
| `python -m kohakuterrarium --version` | 5881.0 ms |
| `kt web --dev` to `/healthz` HTTP 200 | 5218.9 ms |

`-X importtime` loaded 4695 modules for `kohakuterrarium.cli`. Its main
cumulative chain was `kohakuterrarium` -> `studio` ->
`studio.editors.workspace_fs` -> `core.config`.

Raw files are kept locally under `.startup-profile/before/`; this directory is
not a committed benchmark artifact.

## Instrumented surface baseline

| Surface boundary | Samples (ms) | p50 |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Web `api_lifespan_ready` | 5109, 5069, 5097, 5212, 5264 | 5109.2 ms |
| Rich CLI `rich_cli_run_enter` | 8111, 8033, 8073, 8076, 8111 | 8076.2 ms |
| Textual TUI `tui_mounted` | 8311, 8144, 8161, 8153, 8272 | 8160.6 ms |

A single no-argument picker sample found 20 entries in 3 groups. Catalog-scanned
was 8525.9 ms for CLI and 8208.0 ms for TUI, about 240 ms after their parser
milestones.

A manually exercised desktop run reached these cross-process milestones:

| Desktop milestone | Time from parent launch |
| --- | ---: |
| Parent parser ready | 5062.9 ms |
| Child spawned | 5073.1 ms |
| Child app created | 9959.7 ms |
| Child API lifespan ready | 10059.9 ms |
| Desktop server ready | 10163.4 ms |
| Native window created | 10164.4 ms |
| Native window shown | 10750.7 ms |

Port 8001 was already occupied during this sample, so the desktop child used
its verified fallback port 8002. The duplicate `api_lifespan_ready` entry in
that raw trace is consistent with the failed first bind attempt starting the
app lifespan before the fallback server retried; it is a reminder to aggregate
by the final `desktop_server_ready` boundary rather than assuming a single
lifespan event.

Representative p50 phase decomposition:

### Web

| Milestone | p50 from process launch |
| --- | ---: |
| CLI parser ready | 5011.6 ms |
| Web app created | 5016.3 ms |
| Uvicorn run entered | 5017.2 ms |
| API lifespan ready | 5109.2 ms |

### Rich CLI

| Milestone | p50 from process launch |
| --- | ---: |
| Standalone parser ready | 8008.3 ms |
| Engine creation begins | 8021.1 ms |
| Creature added | 8067.8 ms |
| Creature started | 8075.8 ms |
| Rich CLI run entered | 8076.2 ms |

### Textual TUI

| Milestone | p50 from process launch |
| --- | ---: |
| Standalone parser ready | 8041.4 ms |
| Engine creation begins | 8054.3 ms |
| Creature added | 8101.9 ms |
| Creatures started | 8108.0 ms |
| Textual run entered | 8115.5 ms |
| Textual mounted | 8160.6 ms |

The dominant cost remains imports before the first parser milestone. Agent,
engine, and UI setup add tens of milliseconds for the minimal fixture after
imports complete.

## First import-graph optimization

The first optimization pass converted the public package facades to lazy
exports, isolated Studio group-hook registration, and deferred CLI command and
surface imports until dispatch. On the same machine and five-run methodology:

| Measurement | Before p50 | After p50 | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `import kohakuterrarium` | 4953.3 ms | 50.6 ms | -99.0% |
| `import kohakuterrarium.cli` | 5780.5 ms | 200.1 ms | -96.5% |
| `python -m kohakuterrarium --version` | 5881.0 ms | 440.2 ms | -92.5% |
| Web `parser_ready` | 5011.6 ms | 183.7 ms | -96.3% |
| CLI `parser_ready` | 8008.3 ms | 3212.8 ms | -59.9% |
| TUI `parser_ready` | 8041.4 ms | 3204.9 ms | -60.1% |
| Web `api_lifespan_ready` | 5109.2 ms | 5059.9 ms | -1.0% |
| CLI `rich_cli_run_enter` | 8076.2 ms | 7292.6 ms | -9.7% |
| TUI `tui_mounted` | 8160.6 ms | 7175.5 ms | -12.1% |

The control result is important: parser latency fell sharply, while the final
surface boundaries improved much less. The remaining cost moved behind dispatch
into `serving.web` (about 5.0 seconds to import) and `cli.run` plus engine/UI
runtime imports (about 4.0 seconds before engine construction). The next pass
should therefore split those module-level dependency graphs rather than further
optimizing argparse or the public facade.

## Desktop loading-shell optimization

The second optimization pass moved desktop bootstrap into a lightweight module.
The launcher now creates and shows an inline native loading shell first, starts
the heavy FastAPI/Uvicorn server graph after the shown event, and navigates the existing
window to the verified fallback port when the server reports ready.

A real Windows source-checkout smoke run produced:

| Desktop milestone | Time from parent launch |
| --- | ---: |
| Parent parser ready | 206.6 ms |
| Desktop UI child spawned | 215.8 ms |
| Loading window created | 464.0 ms |
| Loading window shown | 1080.5 ms |
| Server child spawned | 1089.5 ms |
| Server ready on fallback port 8002 | 6354.2 ms |

The loading window is therefore visible about 5.3 seconds before the backend is
ready, and about 9.7 seconds earlier than the original 10750.7 ms
`desktop_window_shown` baseline. Server startup remains the next bottleneck; the
loading shell changes T-visible without claiming that the application is fully
ready.

## Web application import optimization

The third optimization pass keeps the `serving.web` launcher independent from
the API application graph and defers runtime-only imports until the selected
provider, tool, local engine, Laboratory host, metrics endpoint, or uploaded
file fallback actually needs them. The complete FastAPI route table is still
registered before Uvicorn starts; this pass does not move startup cost into the
first HTTP request.

A real Windows source-checkout smoke run produced:

| Web milestone | Before | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `web_config_dirs_resolved` | 4951.6 ms | 311.6 ms |
| `web_app_created` | 4954.1 ms | 2103.4 ms |
| `api_lifespan_ready` | 5059.9 ms | 2203.6 ms |

Fresh-process import p50 changed from about 4.97 seconds to 292.0 ms for
`kohakuterrarium.serving.web`. `kohakuterrarium.api.app` now imports in about
2.17 seconds; its remaining cost is dominated by route modules whose runtime
type dependencies still reach Terrarium and Studio session implementations.

## Terminal runtime import optimization

The fourth optimization pass defers the engine, recipe, Drive settings, session
store, and ad-hoc topology modules until terminal runtime construction begins.
It also keeps Textual out of the builtin input/output registries until the TUI
class or `tui` factory is actually requested.

Fresh-process import p50 changed from about 1130.5 ms to 429.6 ms for
`kohakuterrarium.cli.run`; the engine import itself changed from about 1112.7 ms
to 808.7 ms. A Windows source-checkout smoke run with a minimal creature
produced:

| Terminal milestone | Time from launch |
| --- | ---: |
| CLI `parser_ready` | 292.5 ms |
| CLI `engine_create_begin` | 897.0 ms |
| CLI `rich_cli_run_enter` | 1743.9 ms |
| TUI `parser_ready` | 245.7 ms |
| TUI `engine_create_begin` | 877.4 ms |
| TUI `tui_mounted` | 1547.8 ms |

## Measurement limitations

- Desktop `desktop_window_shown` was exercised once before and once after the
  loading-shell change on Windows, but remains a manual GUI measurement. Repeat
  it on every supported desktop platform and report a distribution before
  treating it as a budget.
- Browser FCP and Vue mount are not included. They need browser-side Performance
  API marks in a later frontend-specific pass.
- Cold filesystem-cache and packaged Briefcase measurements remain separate
  follow-ups.
- Enabling JSONL tracing added roughly 0.2 seconds to the very heavy
  `--version` route in a small five-run sample. Compare optimization results
  using the same trace configuration, and retain an uninstrumented control.
- The baseline harness supplied a fresh external wall-clock origin for every
  launched process. Runs that omit it measure from trace-module import instead.
